Following the agile practices aided the product in fitting the specification ensured it was in alignment with the user stories. Three programs were developed which included the Control Panel, Server and Viewer. Network communication, password hashing and salting, session/user management, GUI and databases (MariaDB via JDBC) were other key learning outcomes. Prior to the implementation of the software, low and high-fidelity versions of the software were generated through a UML diagram, wireframe and data flow table.
